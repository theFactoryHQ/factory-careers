## 2026-03-08

### Added

- **Blog: Best Free ATS Software for Startups (2026)** — Cluster 2 supporting roundup article.

Published to `content/blog/best-free-ats-software-for-startups.md`
- **Internal links** — added cross-links from `best-open-source-applicant-tracking-systems.md` (Cluster 2 pillar) and `open-source-vs-free-ats.md` (Cluster 1) to new article

## 2026-03-07

### Added

- **Blog: Open Source vs Free ATS: Why They Aren't the Same** — Cluster 1 supporting article. Explains the difference between free (proprietary) and open source ATS, introduces a 4-category ATS pricing spectrum framework, and includes real infrastructure cost data. Published to `content/blog/open-source-vs-free-ats.md`
- **Internal link** — added cross-link from `open-source-applicant-tracking-system.md` (Cluster 1 pillar) to new supporting article

## 2026-03-04

### Added

- **Blog: How Does an Applicant Tracking System Work?** — Cluster 1 supporting article. Covers the ATS workflow from job posting to hiring decision, resume parsing mechanics, pipeline stages, candidate scoring methods (keyword vs rules vs AI), data ownership, and integrations. Published to `content/blog/how-applicant-tracking-systems-work.md`
- **Internal link** — added cross-link from `open-source-applicant-tracking-system.md` (Cluster 1 pillar) to new supporting article

## 2026-02-28

## 2026-02-22

### Added

- **Blog: Best Open Source Applicant Tracking Systems [2026]** — Cluster 2 pillar page. 3,800-word comparison of 7 open source ATS platforms with TCO analysis, evaluation framework, and FAQ. Published to `content/blog/best-open-source-applicant-tracking-systems.md`
- **Internal link** — added cross-link from `self-hosted-vs-cloud-ats.md` to new pillar page

### Fixed

- **Railway PR seed execution** — removed hard `.env` dependency from `db:seed`; seeding now works with platform-injected env vars and still supports local `.env` loading in `seed.ts`

### Changed

- **Unified Railway seeding path** — Railway predeploy now runs `db:seed` (same script as standard demo data), removing PR-specific seed divergence between preview and production-like environments
- **Preview demo defaults aligned** — runtime preview fallbacks now target `reqcore-demo` and `demo@reqcore.com` to match `server/scripts/seed.ts`

### Removed

- **PR-only seed script** — removed `server/scripts/seed-pr.ts` and the `db:seed:pr` npm script

---
## 2026-02-21

### Fixed

- **Dependency security remediation** — resolved all `npm audit --audit-level=high` findings by upgrading `@aws-sdk/client-s3` (pulling patched `@aws-sdk/xml-builder`) and regenerating lockfile resolution
- **Transitive vulnerability pinning** — added npm `overrides` for `fast-xml-parser`, `minimatch`, `tar`, and `readdir-glob` to keep vulnerable transitive ranges out of the install graph
- **Demo write-protection enforcement** — hardened server demo guard so `POST`/`PATCH`/`PUT`/`DELETE` requests are consistently blocked for the configured demo organization and no longer silently fail open when demo org lookup fails
- **Dashboard preview UX** — write attempts in preview mode now trigger a dedicated upsell modal instead of only inline/API errors, while keeping action buttons visible

### Changed

- **Lockfile hygiene** — refreshed dependency graph with `npm install` + `npm dedupe` to remove stale vulnerable transitive entries
- **Demo env guidance** — `.env.example` demo slug example now matches seeded demo organization slug (`reqcore-demo`) to reduce configuration drift

---
## 2026-02-19

### Changed

- **Deployment platform migration** — migrated from Hetzner VPS (Caddy + systemd) to Railway (managed Nuxt service, Railway PostgreSQL, Railway Storage Buckets)
- **S3 path style now configurable** — `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` env var controls path-style vs virtual-hosted-style S3 URLs (MinIO vs Railway Buckets/AWS S3)
- **S3 bucket plugin** — skips bucket initialization on managed providers (Railway/AWS) where buckets are pre-provisioned
- **`.env.example`** — expanded with full documentation, Railway-specific variable references, and all env vars

### Added

- **`start` script in `package.json`** — `node .output/server/index.mjs` for Railway Nixpacks detection

---
## 2026-02-18

### Added

- **Organic SEO foundation** — `@nuxtjs/seo` (Sitemap, Robots, Schema.org, SEO Utils, Site Config) and `@nuxt/content` v3 (Markdown blog engine with typed collections)
- **Dynamic sitemap** — all open job postings auto-included via `/api/__sitemap__/urls`
- **Robots directives** — `/dashboard/`, `/auth/`, `/api/`, `/onboarding/` blocked from crawling; `noindex` on auth, onboarding, apply, and confirmation pages
- **JSON-LD structured data** — `JobPosting` on job detail (salary, location, remote, employment type), `Organization` + `WebSite` + `WebPage` on landing page, `Article` on blog posts
- **Job SEO fields** — `salaryMin`, `salaryMax`, `salaryCurrency`, `salaryUnit`, `remoteStatus`, `validThrough` added to job schema and all CRUD endpoints
- **Full OG + Twitter Card meta** on all public pages (landing, job board, job detail, roadmap, blog)
- **Blog** — listing page, article detail page with `@tailwindcss/typography` prose styling, seed article "Self-Hosted vs Cloud ATS: Pros, Cons, and When to Switch"
- **ISR route rules** — `/jobs/**` (3600s stale-while-revalidate), prerender for `/`, `/roadmap`, `/blog/**`
- **SVG favicon** — purple rounded rect with white "A"

### Changed

- **Landing page meta description** — optimized for "open source ATS", "self-hosted", "applicant tracking system" keywords

### Added

- **In-app feedback** — floating button in the dashboard opens a modal to submit bug reports or feature requests directly as GitHub Issues. Server-side GitHub API integration with fine-grained PAT (token never exposed to client). Per-user rate limiting (5/hour). Auto-labels issues (`bug` / `enhancement`). Includes reporter context (name, email, page URL). Gracefully hidden when `GITHUB_FEEDBACK_TOKEN` / `GITHUB_FEEDBACK_REPO` env vars are not set.
- **Production deployment** — deployed to Hetzner Cloud CX23 (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM, Ubuntu 24.04) with Caddy reverse proxy, systemd service management, and one-command deploy script (`~/deploy.sh`)
- **Cloudflare CDN** — DNS, DDoS protection, edge caching, SSL termination (Full strict mode), and AI training bot blocking via Cloudflare Free plan
- **Deploy workflow** — `ssh deploy@server '~/deploy.sh'` pulls latest code, installs deps, builds, and restarts the systemd service
- **UFW firewall** — only ports 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS) open

### Fixed

- **S3 bucket policy MinIO compatibility** — replaced `PutBucketPolicy` with `DeleteBucketPolicy` because MinIO doesn't support the `aws:PrincipalType` condition key used in the deny-anonymous policy; buckets without a policy are private by default in MinIO

### Changed

- **S3 bucket privacy strategy** — instead of setting an explicit deny-all policy (which used AWS-only condition keys), the startup plugin now deletes any existing bucket policy to ensure MinIO's default private behavior

### Added

- **Recruiter dashboard** (`app/pages/dashboard/index.vue`) — at-a-glance overview with four stat cards (Open Jobs, Total Candidates, Applications, Unreviewed), pipeline breakdown bar chart with color-coded status segments, jobs by status breakdown, recent applications list with relative timestamps, and top active jobs with new-application badges
- **Dashboard stats API** (`server/api/dashboard/stats.get.ts`) — single endpoint returning all dashboard data: summary counts, pipeline breakdown, jobs by status, recent 10 applications with candidate/job info, and top 5 active jobs by application count — all org-scoped with parallel query execution
- **Dashboard composable** (`app/composables/useDashboard.ts`) — wraps stats endpoint with computed unwrappers for all dashboard sections
- Quick action buttons (Create Job, Add Candidate) in dashboard header
- Welcome empty state for new organizations with CTA to create first job
- Loading skeleton states for all dashboard widgets
- **Public roadmap page** (`app/pages/roadmap.vue`) — cinematic horizontal-scrolling timeline with 15 glassmorphism milestone cards, color-coded by status (shipped/building/vision), scroll-tracking progress glow on the timeline axis, smooth mousewheel-to-horizontal scroll conversion via requestAnimationFrame, and intro card centered on page load
- **Roadmap showcase section on landing page** — "Built in the open" section with mini timeline showing Shipped/Building/Vision counts and prominent CTA to full roadmap
- **Roadmap navigation links** — Roadmap link added to landing page navbar and footer

### Added

- **Dynamic sidebar job tabs** — when viewing a specific job (`/dashboard/jobs/:id/*`), the sidebar shows contextual sub-navigation: Overview, Pipeline, Application Form
- **Application Form tab page** (`app/pages/dashboard/jobs/[id]/application-form.vue`) — dedicated page for custom questions management and shareable application link
- **Sidebar icons** — all main nav items now display Lucide icons (LayoutDashboard, Briefcase, Users, Inbox, LogOut)
- **"All Jobs" sidebar back-link** — quick return to jobs list from any job sub-page

### Changed

- **Sidebar redesign** — replaced scoped CSS with Tailwind utility classes; added dynamic job context section with tab-based navigation
- **Dashboard layout** — removed `max-w-4xl` wrapper from `dashboard.vue`; each page now controls its own `mx-auto max-w-*` for proper centering
- **All dashboard pages** — added `mx-auto` to root elements for centered content within the main area
- **Dashboard index** — converted from `<style scoped>` to Tailwind utility classes
- **Job detail page** — removed "Back to Jobs" link, "View Pipeline" button, application link section, and Application Form Questions section (all moved to sidebar tabs / dedicated application-form page)
- **Pipeline page** — removed "Back to Job" link (sidebar provides navigation)

### Removed

- **"Back to X" links** on job sub-pages — sidebar now provides all navigation context
- **Scoped CSS** in `AppSidebar.vue` and `dashboard/index.vue` — replaced with Tailwind utilities
