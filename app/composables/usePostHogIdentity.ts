/**
 * Composable that syncs the Better Auth session with PostHog identity.
 * Call once in a root-level layout or app.vue to enable automatic
 * user identification and organization group analytics.
 *
 * Must be called in `<script setup>` context (not in a plugin).
 *
 * Identity model
 * --------------
 * Logged-in users are ALWAYS identified by their opaque `user.id` so that
 * funnel + retention analytics work even for visitors who never accept
 * cookies.  Email and name are forwarded ONLY when the user has explicitly
 * consented to analytics — keeping the dashboard PII-free for non-consenters
 * while still letting consented users be looked up by email in PostHog.
 *
 * The watcher depends on `hasConsented`, so when a user clicks "Accept" in
 * the banner the identify() call re-fires immediately and PostHog aliases
 * the anonymous distinct id to the user id (preserving the in-session
 * funnel from anonymous visit → signup → identified user).
