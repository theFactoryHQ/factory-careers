Hiring software shouldn't be complicated or expensive. Most applicant tracking systems charge per seat, lock your data in their cloud, and overwhelm you with features you don't need. Reqcore is a lightweight, open-source ATS you can self-host in minutes. No per-seat fees, no vendor lock-in, no bloat — just a clean tool that helps you hire.

> **Early open-source release** — Reqcore is actively developed and improving every week. The foundation is solid (jobs, pipeline, applications, documents, job board), but some features are still on the roadmap. Check the [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for what's shipped and what's next.

## Why Reqcore?

*Simple hiring software you actually own.*

## Features

- **Job management** — Create, edit, and track jobs through draft → open → closed → archived
- **Candidate pipeline** — Drag candidates through screening → interview → offer → hired with a Kanban board
- **Public job board** — SEO-friendly job listings with custom slugs that applicants can browse and apply to
- **Custom application forms** — Add custom questions (text, select, file upload, etc.) per job
- **Document storage** — Upload and manage resumes and cover letters via S3-compatible storage (MinIO)
- **Multi-tenant organizations** — Isolated data per organization with role-based membership
- **Recruiter dashboard** — At-a-glance stats, pipeline breakdown, recent applications, and top active jobs
- **Secure document access** — Resumes are never exposed via public URLs; all access is authenticated and streamed
- **Built-in rate limiting** — Protection against abuse on all endpoints out of the box

## Quick Start

> **Windows users:** Open [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org) and run all commands there instead of Command Prompt or PowerShell.

---

### Option A — Use the pre-built image (fastest)

No cloning, no building. Pull the official image and run:

```bash
mkdir reqcore && cd reqcore
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reqcore-inc/reqcore/main/docker-compose.production.yml
curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reqcore-inc/reqcore/main/setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** and sign up. That's it.

To update: `docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml pull app && docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d`

---

### Option B — Build from source

---

### Step 1 — Install Docker

Docker packages the app, database, and file storage into containers so you don't have to install anything else manually.

| Your OS | How to install |
|---------|---------------|
| **Mac** | [Download Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) → install → open it |
| **Windows** | [Download Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) → install → open it |
| **Linux** | Follow the [Docker Engine install guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for your distro |

Once installed, verify Docker is running:

```bash
docker --version
```

You should see something like `Docker version 27.x.x`. If you get `command not found`, Docker isn't running yet — open Docker Desktop and try again.

---

### Step 2 — Download Reqcore

Clone the repository (this downloads the source code):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reqcore-inc/reqcore.git
cd reqcore
```

> Don't have `git`? [Download it here](https://git-scm.com/downloads), or [download a ZIP](https://github.com/reqcore-inc/reqcore/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it manually.

---

### Step 3 — Generate your secret keys

This creates a `.env` file containing random passwords and secrets. You only run this once.

```bash
./setup.sh
```

You'll see: `✅ .env generated with random secrets.`

> **Windows CMD / PowerShell?** Run `cp .env.example .env` instead, then open `.env` and replace every placeholder value with a random string of your choice.

---

### Step 4 — Start the app

```bash
docker compose up
```

**The very first run takes 3–5 minutes** while Docker builds the app image and downloads dependencies. This is normal — you only wait this long once. Subsequent starts take seconds.

When you see a line like:

```
app  | Listening on http://[::]:3000
```

...the app is ready.

---

### Step 5 — Open Reqcore

Go to **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser.

Click **Sign up** to create your account and first organization. That's it — you're running your own ATS.

---

### Optional: Load demo data

Want to explore with pre-filled jobs, candidates, and a pipeline? Open a **new terminal window** while the app is running and run:

```bash
docker compose exec app npm run db:seed
```

Then sign in with:
- **Email:** `demo@thefactoryhq.com`
- **Password:** `demo1234`

---

### Updating to a new release

When a new version of Reqcore is released, follow these steps **in order** to update your instance. Your data is safe — updates never delete the database or your uploaded files.

#### Pre-built image users

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml pull app
docker compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

#### Build from source users

**Step 1 — Pull the latest code**

```bash
git pull origin main
```

**Step 2 — Rebuild and restart the app**

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

This rebuilds the app image with the new code, applies any new database migrations automatically on startup, and restarts in the background. The whole process typically takes under a minute.

**Step 3 — Verify it's running**

```bash
docker compose logs app --tail 20
```

Look for `Listening on http://[::]:3000`. Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) — you're on the latest version.

> **Something wrong after an update?** Roll back by running `git checkout <previous-commit>` and then `docker compose up --build -d`.

> **To find the latest release notes**, check the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) or [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/reqcore-inc/reqcore/releases).

---

### Managing your instance

```bash
# Stop the app (your data is kept)
docker compose down

# Start it again
docker compose up

# Rebuild after pulling new code
docker compose up --build

# Stop and delete ALL data (irreversible)
docker compose down -v
```

---

### What's running

| Service | URL | Description |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **App** | [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) | The Reqcore web UI |
| **MinIO Console** | [localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) | File storage browser (S3-compatible) |
| **Adminer** | [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) | Database browser — only with `--profile tools` |

To enable Adminer (a visual database browser):

```bash
docker compose --profile tools up
# Open http://localhost:8080
# System: PostgreSQL  |  Server: db  |  Username & Password: from your .env
```

---

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to do |
|---------|-----------|
| `docker: command not found` | Docker isn't installed, or Docker Desktop isn't open yet |
| `permission denied: ./setup.sh` | Run `chmod +x setup.sh` first, then try again |
| App shows a connection error | The first build is still running — wait 30 seconds, then refresh |
| Port 3000 or 5432 already in use | Another app is using that port — stop it, or edit the port in `docker-compose.yml` |
| Upload / file errors | Run `docker compose logs minio` — MinIO may still be starting up |
| Need to rotate a secret | Edit `.env`, then run `docker compose up --build` |

| **Docker Compose** | Postgres + MinIO (localhost only) |
| **systemd** | Process management with auto-restart |

### Deploy

```bash
ssh deploy@your-server '~/deploy.sh'
# Pulls latest code, installs, builds, restarts — zero downtime
```

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full deployment architecture diagram.
